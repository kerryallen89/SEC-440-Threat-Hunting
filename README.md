## Course Stuff

### Course Objectives:

This comprehensive, lab-intensive course is structured to provide students with a detailed understanding of modern cyber defense and offense strategies. From setting up resilient infrastructures to performing advanced threat detection and response, students will explore the critical skills required to operate effectively in complex cybersecurity environments. With a blend of offensive and defensive methodologies, the course offers a holistic perspective, enabling students to better predict, prevent, and respond to advanced persistent threats (APTs).

### Course Outcomes:

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Configure and secure cyber infrastructures tailored to specific team roles (red and blue teams).
* Conduct comprehensive network traffic analysis and derive actionable insights.
* Perform offensive cyber operations using advanced techniques such as privilege escalation and process injection.
* Utilize forensic and hunting tools to detect, respond to, and mitigate cyber threats.
* Develop and apply YARA rules and IOCs for malware analysis and threat detection.
* Understand and counteract techniques used for persistence, lateral movement, and credential abuse.
* Analyze and mitigate risks associated with data exfiltration over various channels.
* Strengthen access controls and understand the exploitation of Active Directory environments.
